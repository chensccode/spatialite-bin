## SpatiaLite Binaries

This package contains shared libraries of SpatiaLite for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
The libraries have no dependencies other than things available by default by the
operating systems. These are shipped as mod_spatialite libraries that can be loaded
using the SQL `load_extension()` function.
